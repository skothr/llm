# Three Glyph Views: CAV Decomposition, Haiku Flipbook, Counterfactual Diff

**Date:** 2026-05-13
**Model:** Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, layer 20 (CPU bf16)
**Toolkit:** `nla_cav_glyph.py` + `nla_haiku_flipbook.py` + `nla_counterfactual_glyph_diff.py`
**Inputs:** the four `.pt` artifacts in `testing/.cache/nla_artifacts/` (no model loading)
**Figures:** `fig13`, `fig14`, `fig15` in `research/observations/figures/`

## Path-batch goal

Test three quick variants of the signature-glyph primitive against existing artifacts: render the country CAV as a glyph (and test H3), build a per-step flipbook for the haiku trajectory, and render forced-natural counterfactual glyph diffs. No model calls; all data already on disk.

## Finding 1 — fig13 — H3 falsified, sinks ARE content-modulated

H3 from the [sink-removed atlas note](2026-05-13-nla-sink-removed-atlas.md) predicted cos(CAV_unit, e_32) ≥ +0.4. **Result: +0.0510. H3 FAIL.** The country CAV direction is **genuinely distributed across hundreds of dimensions**, not single-dim aligned. The top single contributor is dim **1803** at +0.124 (only **1.5%** of the direction's squared norm), and the top 20 dims combined account for only **~14%** of the variance.

The structure of the top-20 contributors:

| rank | dim | CAV_unit value | sq share | classifier label |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 1803 | +0.124 | 0.015 | not in top-20 hot |
| 2 | 1111 | -0.117 | 0.014 | not in top-20 hot |
| 3 | 3206 | +0.114 | 0.013 | polarized |
| 4 | **2953** | **+0.113** | 0.013 | **feature** |
| 5 | 2202 | -0.105 | 0.011 | not in top-20 hot |
| 6 | **2107** | **-0.104** | 0.011 | **sink** |
| 7 | 2940 | +0.095 | 0.009 | not in top-20 hot |
| 8 | **3110** | **-0.094** | 0.009 | **sink** |
| ... | | | | |
| 15 | **2570** | **+0.076** | 0.006 | **sink** |

Two structural observations:

1. **The classifier-identified feature dims are NOT the country-discriminating dims.** Of our 8 feature dims (20, 32, 392, 608, 1121, 1790, 2604, 2953), only **dim 2953** appears in the CAV's top-10 contributors. The classifier found dims with "feature-bearing geometry" (sign-flipping × bursty) but those general-content dims aren't where country-vs-non-country signal lives. The country signal lives in dims with weaker general-content character.

2. **3 of the top 8 CAV contributors are SINK dims** (2107: -0.10, 3110: -0.09, 2570: +0.08). I'd assumed sinks contribute zero to content axes because they're nearly constant. But "nearly constant" ≠ "constant." Sinks pick up tiny systematic differences between country and non-country prompts, and at the resolution of difference-of-means CAV computation, those tiny modulations matter. **Sinks have a content-modulated component on top of their large constant offset.**

### Design implication

The signature-glyph primitive should be **parameterized by which dims to show**. The default ("general-content glyph") uses the 8 feature dims and gives a universal background view. **Concept-specific glyphs** should show the top-K contributors to a specific CAV direction — they reveal the discriminator structure for that concept. Same primitive, different dim selection, two different views.

## Finding 2 — fig14 — Haiku flipbook (token / glyph / AV / AR-cos per step)

Per-step view of the 15 rabbit-haiku generation captures. Reading top to bottom:
- step 0 'Soft' — opening commitment, AR cos 0.862
- step 7 ' bree' — mid-BPE-commit position, AR cos 0.877 (highest)
- step 14 '—' — final em-dash, AR cos 0.811 (low diffuse position)

The per-step glyph changes visibly between content-decision steps (0, 7) and connective steps (3-5: 'through', 'grass', ',') — confirming the **content-position rhythm** noted in the geometric deep dive. The full AV text is readable in the figure at 130 dpi; thumbnail is compressed.

This is the cheapest "interpretability rendered visually" artifact — every signal (token, geometric signature, NL interpretation, fidelity) is in one row per step.

## Finding 3 — fig15 — Counterfactual ||Δh||_feat ranks counterfactual surprise

For each of the 4 forced-continuation pairs, computed the glyph difference (forced − natural) in the feature-dim subspace:

| pair | prompt | natural → forced | ||Δh||_feat |
|---|---|---|---|
| negation | "Is the sky blue?" | Yes → No | **5.72** |
| factual | "What is the capital of France?" | Paris → Berlin | **8.70** |
| math | "What is 2+2?" | 4 → 5 | **10.97** |
| refusal_metaware | "What is 2+2?" | 4 → ' refuse' | **35.55** |

The progression 5.7 → 8.7 → 11.0 → 35.6 separates **two qualitatively different counterfactual classes**:

* **Wrong-but-plausible** (Yes/No, Paris/Berlin, 4/5): ||Δh||_feat in [5, 11]. The model's representation moves a small amount because both answers are valid candidates of the same kind. The forced token is "within the model's space of expected continuations."
* **Out-of-distribution forcing** (4 → refuse-to-answer-2+2): ||Δh||_feat = 35.6, ~4× larger. The model would never spontaneously refuse to answer "What is 2+2?"; forcing it produces a radically different residual.

This **was not visible from the AV text alone** — the AV reads templated 3-paragraph descriptions in all cases. The geometric divergence is the signal that distinguishes "model is computing a wrong-but-believable thing" from "model is being pushed off-distribution."

## Hypotheses

### H4 — ||Δh||_feat could be used as a counterfactual-anomaly detector
If the relationship generalizes, a streamlined "ablation severity" score for any forced completion is just ||h_forced − h_natural||_feat. Threshold above ~20 = "the model is being pushed out of distribution"; threshold below ~12 = "wrong but believable."

**Test:** generate a batch of forced completions spanning [trivially plausible, definitely impossible] and measure ||Δh||_feat for each. Predict a clean bimodal distribution.

### H5 — Concept-specific glyphs require their own feature-dim selection
The signature-glyph primitive needs to be parameterized by the dim set. For each named concept (country, code, person, emotion), one would build a CAV, identify its top-K contributors, and use those K dims as the glyph rays.

**Test:** repeat for 5 concepts; check whether each concept's top-K dim set is mostly disjoint from the others. If so, concept-glyph dim sets are concept-specific, and a "universal glyph" framework needs a way to compose multiple concept-aware projections.

### H6 — Sinks carry a small but real content-modulated component
Sinks are MOSTLY constant but not entirely. Their content modulation surfaces in the CAV. **Test:** decompose each sink dim's variance over the 167 captures into "constant + content-modulated" terms; predict the constant part is 90%+ of variance for the strongest sinks (2570, 458) and <50% for the weakest "polarized" dims.

## Reproducibility

```bash
cd /home/ai/ai-projects/llm/.claude/worktrees/nla-research

PYTHONPATH=$PWD/testing /home/ai/ai-projects/llm/testing/.venv/bin/python \
    testing/examples/nla_cav_glyph.py                     # fig13
PYTHONPATH=$PWD/testing /home/ai/ai-projects/llm/testing/.venv/bin/python \
    testing/examples/nla_haiku_flipbook.py                # fig14
PYTHONPATH=$PWD/testing /home/ai/ai-projects/llm/testing/.venv/bin/python \
    testing/examples/nla_counterfactual_glyph_diff.py     # fig15
```

All three CPU-only, no model loading, ~1 minute total.

## Follow-ups

1. **Path B — semantic interpolation flipbook.** Now the highest-value next experiment. AR(text_A) → AR(text_B) interpolation × 20 steps × AV-decode. ~30 min AV-call budget. The signature-glyph primitive lets us *visualize* the trajectory in addition to reading the AV text at each step.

2. **Concept library + glyph atlas.** Repeat the CAV methodology for 5 concepts (country, math, code, person, emotion). For each, store the top-K dims and the AV-decoded interpretation. Build a 5-concept glyph atlas where each capture has 5 concept-specific glyphs alongside the general-content glyph.

3. **||Δh||_feat as a counterfactual-anomaly scoring tool.** Test H4. Could become a building block for adversarial-prompt detection in deployment.

4. **Decompose each sink dim's variance into constant + content-modulated.** Tests H6 and refines the sink/feature classifier.
